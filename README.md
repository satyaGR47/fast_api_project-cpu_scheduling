This project is just for recalling the cpu scheduling algorithms(operating system) which we studied in our college time.
I have tried to implement non-premtive cpu scheduling so far using FAST API, HTML, CSS.

run the main.py using below command to see the output.

- uvicorn main:app --reload
if uvicorn not installed in system please installed it.
